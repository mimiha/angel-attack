whenever you attack an enemy the total comboes go up, starting at a combo of 10 hits without damage
if you take damage then your combos reset, this is a trait for EACH character, so each on ehas their combo counter, so if one person fucks up the rest of the group isn't compromised.
the higher you get your combos, the more "skill points" you get to spend on attributes like more attack or faster speed or something like that
your SP is rewarded once your combos reset, and there is a minimum amount of SP you can get when you start a combo (so if you do a 10 hit and fuck up, you'll get the minimum)
