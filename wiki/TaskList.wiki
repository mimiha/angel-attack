#summary shit that needs to get done

= Introduction =

let's get this shit done


= list =

==High priority==
 * monster AI (currently only Demon.cs)
 * more players, next one is ESPION. See characters page for specifics
 * *LINKED LIST MANAGING - WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE THE FUCKING THING*

==Mid priority==
 * multiplayer support (good tutorial: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb203893%28v=XNAGameStudio.31%29.aspx)
 * adding sound support (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb203895%28v=XNAGameStudio.31%29.aspx)
 * better collision checking, right now it's a disaster
 * combo system - go read other wiki page

==Low priority==
 * double jumping
 * special attacks implementation
 * particle effects


==other shit==
 * blending is cool i need to learn this http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb976070%28v=XNAGameStudio.31%29.aspx




==Specific things being worked on atm==
 * i need to create a line of sight for enemies that consists of half (or more) of their body to X amount in front of them, so that espion can tell whether he is in the back of the enemy or not. this is pretty much imperative to his gameplay and needs to get done
 * dashing is still pretty buggy but i need to test for specific kinks
 * Need to implement REGULAR MELEE ATTACKING and not projectiles like grenadier. this is another hump in espion's coding.
  * Temporary solution maybe?: Have the effect of the swing (the swoosh) have a bounding box
 * WE NEED A START SCREEN, LOLZ.
 * BLARG
