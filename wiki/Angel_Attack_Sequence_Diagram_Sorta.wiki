This is mainly for me to document the function calling flow of the different objects we've created in Angel Attacks. If it's useful good, else just ignore it.

= Things to keep in mind =
  * Most classes that are moving "Sprite" derived objects use the "Update()". 
  * XNA calls it's own "Game.Update()" our "Game1.Update()" in a continuous loop.
  * Functions listed will be ones created in Angel Attack only. 

= Classes using Update() =
 * = Sprite =
   * **

 * = Bullet = 
 * = Grenadier = 
 * = LesserDemon = 
 * = Spawner = 

= Classes not using Update() =
 * = Text =
 * = Wall = 
 * = Protectee =
 * = Block =
